# CIS4930Project
Joseph Gravelle and Masen Beliveau

Summary:
So far we have created the event class and event loop that will simulate the events, an lru cache that we will use as the first cache implementation, and a file and remote server class that we will use for file management. We used c++ as our language of choice.

How to run:
We have a makefile, so just run "make" in the terminal in the project directory and the files will compile and run. You must have c++ installed to compile the code though.

Thank you,
Joseph Gravelle
